# waveFlume



Suite of data analysis codes for a teaching-and-learning project studying waves in a flume.



The flume and the wavemaker are described in a YouTube video:

* The flume is made from wood and Perspex and the wavemaker is made from Lego.
* Data from the wavemaker was captured using a mobile phone and uploaded to YouTube.
* The frames from the video have been extracted and digitized.
* The free surface from each frame has been stored in a csv file available here (/data).
* The data has been postprocessed to extract the waveform.
* Postprocessing routines (using matlab) are available here (/model1 and /model2).



The results are consistent with classical linear water-wave theory in the small-amplitude approximation.
